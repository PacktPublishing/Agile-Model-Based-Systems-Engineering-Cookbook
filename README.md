**Improve system development by applying proven recipes for effective agile systems engineering**

## What is this book about?
Model-based systems engineering provides an integrated approach to creating verifiable models of engineering data, rather than relying on traditional and vague natural language descriptions that are difficult to verify. This enables you to work on accurate specifications and rapidly design reliable and effective products for the marketplace. Agile MBSE integrates the value proposition of agile methods in systems development, most notably, for managing constant change and uncertainty while continuously ensuring system correctness and meeting customersâ€™ needs. 

This book covers the following exciting features:
* Apply agile methods to develop systems engineering specifications
* Perform functional analysis with SysML
* Derive and model systems architectures from key requirements
* Model crucial engineering data to clarify systems requirements
* Communicate decisions with downstream subsystem implementation teams
* Verify specifications with model reviews and simulations
* Ensure the accuracy of systems models through model-based testing

## Get to Know the Author
**Dr. Bruce Powel Douglass**
was raised by wolves in the Oregon wilderness. He taught himself to read at age 3 and calculus before age 12. He dropped out of school when he was 14 and traveled around the US for a few years before entering the University of Oregon as a mathematics major. He eventually received his MS in exercise physiology from the University of Oregon and his Ph.D. in neurocybernetics from the USD Medical School. Bruce has worked as a software developer and systems engineer in safety-critical real-time embedded systems for almost 40 years and is a well-known speaker, author, and consultant in the area of real-time embedded systems, UML, and SysML. He is a coauthor of the UML and SysML standards. He develops and teaches courses as well as consulting in real-time systems and software design and project management and has done so for many years. He has authored articles for many journals and periodicals, especially in the real-time domain. He worked at I-Logix, Telelogic, and IBM on the Rhapsody modeling tool. He is currently a senior principal agile systems engineer at MITRE, and the principal at A-Priori Systems.
He is the author of several other books on systems and software development, including Doing Hard Time: Developing Real-Time Systems with UML,
Objects, Frameworks and Patterns (Addison-Wesley, 1999), Real-Time Design Patterns: Robust Scalable Architecture for Real-Time Systems (Addison-Wesley, 2002), Real-Time UML 3rd Edition: Advances in the UML for Real-Time Systems (Addison-Wesley, 2004), Real-Time Agility (Addison-Wesley, 2009), Design Patterns for Embedded Systems in C (Elsevier, 2011), Real-Time UML Workshop for Embedded Systems (Elsevier, 2014), Agile Systems Engineering (Elsevier, 2016), and several others, including a short textbook on table tennis.
Bruce is an active Ironman triathlete and competitive ultra-marathon cyclist.
